title: About Me
---

About pages are a peculiar type of navel-gazing. My writing is so seldom _not_ about me, so rarely _not_ about how I think or what I see. An about me is just a more transparent _dramatis personae_ I'm performing as. I don the costume of the person I want to be seen as, give this person lines and a backstory, and in a few paragraphs, I've manufactured this character's self-affirming monologue.

Perhaps I could summarize myself by listing a bunch of nouns, of things I like or things I eat or things I make, building a composite me of the material stuff of my life. But does knowing I'm a "reader" tell you who I am? You can affix me within whatever mental model you have of "people who like to read" and say this guy is like those other "readers". Which probably wouldn't be wrong. Imagine a guy who likes to read and loves dogs and is a technologist and you probably aren't too far off. In the words of Ted Lasso, different people are different people, but those differences are often in the margins.

Or do I dare a more circumspect meditation on _self_, trying to balance sounding smart with try-too-hard smart; an anvil on floss. A balance some who've made it this far might call drunkenly teetering at best, who might say trade the anvil for cruise liner and you've got a better sense of the balance this guy's struck between effortless and effortful, claiming anyone who uses the term _dramatis personae_ in any context whatsoever can't pretend to not be trying _a bit too hard_.

Like the Treaty of Tordesillas, I'm going draw a line of demarcation, and walk it. Divide this uncharted world of "me" between the head-firmly-inserted-into-navel meditation on self and the ordered list of likes and dislikes. Below are five things I think about myself and the world, the cognitions at the core of who I think I am.

1. I am deeply curious about everything. Curiosity and persistence is the secret sauce of creativity, the bedrock of mastery, autonomy, and purpose.
2. Most everything is made up, problems are almost always communication problems, and most any system, whether technological or organizational or interpersonal, can be understood.
3. I have a deep and abiding hatred of boredom. I'm privileged to be able to worry about boredom rather than physiological or safety needs.
4. I am a people pleaser but exhausted by social interaction. One time as a socially awkward kid I made a group of people laugh and I've been chasing that high ever since.
5. I want to be extraordinary.
