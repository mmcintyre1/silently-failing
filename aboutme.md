title: About Me
---

About pages are a peculiar type of navel-gazing. My writing is so seldom _not_ about me, so rarely _not_ about how I think or what I see. An about me is just a more transparent _dramatis personae_ I'm performing as. I don the costume of the person I want to be seen as, give this person lines and a backstory, and in a few paragraphs, I've manufactured this character's self-affirming monologue.

I could summarize myself by listing a bunch of nouns, of things I like or things I eat or things I make, building a composite me of the material stuff of my life. But does knowing I'm a "reader" tell you who I am? You can affix me within whatever mental model you have of "people who like to read" and say this guy is like those other "readers". Which probably wouldn't be wrong. Imagine someone who likes to read, is a technologist, and not only has dogs but also an inordinate amount of pictures of dogs and dogs feature heavily in his day to day and identity and you probably aren't too far off. In the words of Ted Lasso, different people are different people, but those differences are often declared in the margins.

I could attempt a more circumspect meditation on _self_, trying to balance a consuming desire to sound With It and smart but also aloof and not really concerned with whether you think I'm With It; an anvil on floss. A balance some who've made it this far might call drunkenly teetering at best, who might say trade the anvil for cruise liner and you've got a better sense of the balance you've struck between Fonzi-esque effortless and Urkel-like effortful, claiming anyone who uses the term _dramatis personae_ in any context whatsoever without being prepended with the phrase "what the hell is" can't pretend to not be trying _a bit too hard_.

Like the Treaty of Tordesillas, I'm going draw a line of demarcation between head-firmly-inserted-into-navel meditation on who I really am and the ordered list of likes and dislikes (I don't think that metaphor has a strong enough foundation to actually assign Portugal or Spain to either side). Instead, here are five things I think about myself.

1. I am deeply curious about everything. Curiosity and persistence is the secret sauce of creativity, the bedrock of mastery, autonomy, and purpose.
2. Most everything is made up, problems are almost always communication problems, and most any system, whether technological or organizational or interpersonal, can be understood.[^fna]
3. I have a deep and abiding hatred of boredom. I'm privileged to be able to worry about boredom rather than physiological or safety needs.
4. One time as a socially awkward kid I made a group of people laugh and I've been chasing that high ever since.
5. I want to be extraordinary.
