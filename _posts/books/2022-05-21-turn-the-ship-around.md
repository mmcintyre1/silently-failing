> You may be able to “buy” a person’s back with a paycheck, position, power, or fear, but a human being’s genius, passion, loyalty, and tenacious creativity are volunteered only.

I've read a lot of business books in my life. It's difficult to resist the urge, in reviewing any new business book, to situate it in a usual suspects lineup of other business books, to overlay the new book's cliches and self-fulfilling case studies and available-for-consultancy corporate frameworks for sale against other book's cliches and self-fulfilling case studies and available-for-consultancy corporate frameworks for sale. Inevitably we levy the same handful of criticisms: a judicious editor could cut the message down to a postcard[^fn1], the examples are as convenient as a 22-minute sitcom drama/resolution arc, and the writing the type snooze-fest I'd normally enact with a sleep-schedule resetting two-beer-and-a-swig-of-Nyquil evening.

But despite the popular wisdom, the devil really isn't in the details with these books. It's not so much the wisdom they dispense but rather the way it makes us think about how we work, why we make the choices we do, and how we can be more effective in those choices. Business books are valuable to me because they offer me a prism to _reflect_ upon my work, to inject some intentionality and deliberateness into a day-to-day that is largely spent reacting, jumping from incident to incident, furnishing judgments with little to no context, dealing with human problems of frustration or burnout or incompatibility or miscommunications. Fundamentally, most problems fit into a kitchen-drawer of archetypal groupings, and more often than not, success is founded in the strength of our communications.

> The leader-leader structure is fundamentally different from the leader-follower structure. At its core is the belief that we can all be leaders and, in fact, it’s best when we all are leaders. Leadership is not some mystical quality that some possess and others do not. As humans, we all have what it takes, and we all need to use our leadership

David Marquet, in _Turn the Ship Around!_, outlines his vision for how a leader should operate. Marquet advocates for pushing control down into all levels of an organization, to "shift focus from avoiding errors to achieving excellence", to move past leaders of the past, built on a cult of personality and the charisma of a single dictatorial leader in charge. Marquet uses his time as captain on the Los Angeles-class submarine the _Santa Fe_ as a framing device for his dispensed wisdom, each chapter running a handful of pages and covering a small topic via a parable-like anecdote of some problem and subsequent resolution on the _Santa Fe_.

If that description sounds dismissive, it isn't meant to be. Business books aren't the apogee of human culture[^fn2]. They are didactic, read quickly or skimmed entirely. As much as a business book can be a page-turner, Marquet's book is that. It's like Jack Reacher as an actuary. The framing device is effective, and the questions to consider at the end of each chapter are legitimately good, especially if actually considered. Marquet's book doesn't commit the cardinal sin of any business book, which is to be dogmatic. This is a book that takes a very simple idea, that control should be pushed down in any organization and that this control needs to be tent-staked to the ground via competence and mission clarity, and applies it to real-life, plausible[^fn3] scenarios aboard a 2 billion dollar submarine carrying enough materiel to decimate any number of large metropolitan cities and unleash World War III.

While the book is geared towards executive leadership, you can also apply these principles at any level. {paragraph about book applicablity}

[^fn1]: <sub>I'm no Keynesian, but I'd imagine the market for books, however emaciated it's been rendered over the last 25 years by an increasingly reluctant readership, is still outpacing the postcard market, hell, even the pamphlet market. Research pending.</sub>
[^fn2]: <sub>That said, I'm sure there are some real sickos that put things like Carnegie's _How to Win Friends and Influence People_ on best literature lists, because of it's _impact_ or something.</sub>
[^fn3]:<sub>The best verisimilitude any of these books can aspire to is "plausible". I don't know if it's the fact that I grew up without and then with the internet, but I default to the notion that nothing really happens, or at least not like the way people say it does; reality is diffracted and refracted through so many competing biases and human limitations as to be basically impossible to objectively retell. Add in the clear economic interest any business book writer has for their particular ideology and there's no chance any example bandied about to justify said ideology's efficacy by said business book writer actually happened.</sub>
