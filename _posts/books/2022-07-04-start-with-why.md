I'd start with calling this book a demagogue's playbook, but "playbook" implies an instructional cohesion this soggy mishmash of poorly researched cargo-culting, emotional pablum, and chewing-with-mouth-open-annoying capitalized interrogative pronouns completely lacks. The book is a prime example of all that is wrong with this genre: not every good idea or good TED talk should be a book. And yet this one, as the book flap tells me, has sold over a million copies, so what do I know about the publishing industry?

The core idea here that Sinek, a converted ad-man and now self-actualizer, is peddling is that businesses and leaders are more successful if they, you guessed it, start with why they are doing anything. Good business arises from clearly communicated vision statements, as it were. There is a hierarchical circle of WHY, HOW, and WHAT that Sinek says needs to be "balanced" or you won't be able to compel blind, emotional loyalty in your customers and followers. Sinek claims to borrow from nature's _golden ratio_, the ubiquitous math that seems to dictate much of what we find beautiful in nature [^fn1], but Sinek's Golden Circle might as well be named for the Golden Hind or a golden potato for all it shares with that mathematical constant.

In Sinek's world, there is good marketing and bad marketing, and all business radiates outward from that. He very typically conflates leaders with their business strategy, as if any good business requires a singular dictatorial banner-carrying leader at the center banging the drum of vision and despite literally thousands of counter-examples. Perhaps his argument is more about those singular, once-in-a-generation geniuses that are innovation unto themselves. Then Sinek seems to be arguing that everyone just needs to be more like Steve Jobs, and you can start with being clear why you do anything. Sinek dedicates much of the textual real estate here as a fan's notes on Apple and Jobs, a slavish and ingratiatingly shallow analysis of why the company was so successful in building a brand.

Sinek's analysis is exceptionally shallow throughout the book. TiVo fails because they didn't have vision, not because it breaking a device into the oligopoly of cable markets where inertia and anti-competitive practices mean you need to start by cutting out cable entirely to make headway in the industry [^fn2]. But hey, people wait six months to get Harley-Davidsons, so why didn't TiVO work? Another example: Orville and Wilbur Wright pioneered the first plane because they really wanted to fly and thus were persistent. Another: Martin Luther King Jr. was pretty charismatic and was good at building a movement that transcended himself.

These sorts of superficial examples thread what is generally a poorly organized book. It doesn't feel like Sinek is building to anything; an argument isn't being structured, examples don't appear to be layered. Sinek has two pitches here, which is to talk about Apple and sprinkle some WHYs and WHATs and HOWs[^fn3] to justify his thesis, or to extend his central "Golden Circle" metaphor in some confusing direction, e.g., the circle isn't just a circle, it's a megaphone!

The book posits a hierarchical leadership, with a heliocentric Mussolini-type in the center appealing to raw emotion. The phenomenology of success then is a conflation of the marketing of a product to the cult of personality of a brand's leader, and Sinek employs thinly researched straw-men to justify this world-view. The central truism, that why you do what you do matters as much or more than what you do, is padded by hundreds of mind-numblingly useless pages riddled with post-facto arguments and survivor bias. Sinek builds a one-in-a-million ubermensch of a leader and claims that that target is an inspiration. Being a once-in-a-lifetime visionary who can change an industry is nice, but sometimes you are just selling used cars, and car is just a car.

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

[^fn1]: This book came out within three years of the Da Vinci code and perhaps a collective buzz around the golden ratio, so perhaps to lend some psuedo-scientific gleam to the work, Sinek has co-opted an art term.
[^fn2]: Netflix and other streaming companies cut out the cable box entirely.
[^fn3]: By a simple case-sensitive count, WHY occurs 537 times, WHAT 196, and HOW a refreshing 120 times.
