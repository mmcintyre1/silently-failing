## Business And Self-Help Books

### Effortless: Make it Easier to Do what Matters Most
Rating: 5/10

Your mileage may vary depending on how similar you think achieving hard business outcomes is to free throw shooting. McKeown moves adjectivally from his first book, from _Essentialism_ to _Effortless_ (one could imagine the -ness was dropped in some editing room with a hard-and-fast rule dictating that single word titles can't exceed 3 syllables or 3 s'es). McKeown outlines three stages of achieving this effortlessness, from effortless state to effortless actions to effortless results. There is some valuable, although commonsensical, advice (get enough sleep, be an active listener) interspersed with some Fletcherism (essential work broken down to three sessions of no more than 90 minutes, don't do more today than you can recover from today, clear physical clutter to clear mental clutter). McKeown also claims to leverage cognitive research to validate his theories, and while there are passing references to things like perceptual load theory or the cognitive ease principle, this book is not about the research. It's a fast read and if nothing else is valuable for the idea of inverting hard problems to ask what they would look like if they were easy. That, and we should all be taking more _effortless_ naps.

### Start With Why
Rating: 3/10

Not much more to gain from this beyond the title. [Link](/books/start-with-why) to longer review.

### Turn the Ship Around
Rating: 6/10

A solid sea-faring jaunt. [Link](/books/turn-the-ship-around) to longer review.

### The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering
Rating: 8/10

This is one that straddles the line between business and tech, so in lieu of low value genre dissections, I've picked one. The book's reputation is merited, and [the Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is in full display. [Link](/books/the-mythical-man-month) to longer review
