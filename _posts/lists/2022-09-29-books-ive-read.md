This list isn't meant to be entirely comprehensive to all books I've read. Most of the books I've forgotten about, and I didn't think to start doing this until recently. I keep a more diligent list on my [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23744091-michael-mcintyre), as well as more substantive notes on most books at [https://itsmynotes.com](https://itsmynotes.com).

### Think Again
**Rating**: 7/10

Self-help books fall along a gradient of scientific rigor. Fortunately, _Think Again_ makes its case for rethinking by bolstering its argument with studies, presented as evidence rather than justification, and strips out the simplistic geometric images of most self-help books that, although make good slideshow presentations for selling a consultancy framework, often deceive or over-simplify. Grant takes your time more seriously (although he doesn't take himself too seriously, peppering the book with humorous comics and images). The book is a compelling toolset for personal rethinking, although there might've been some room to more thoroughly declare an epistemology and especially how that is tied up with our identities.

### Effortless
**Rating**: 5/10

Your mileage may vary depending on how similar you think achieving hard business outcomes is to free throw shooting. McKeown moves adjectivally from his first book, from _Essentialism_ to _Effortless_ (one could imagine the -ness was dropped in some editing room with a hard-and-fast rule dictating that single word titles can't exceed 3 syllables or 3 s'es). McKeown outlines three stages of achieving this effortlessness, from effortless state to effortless actions to effortless results. There is some valuable, although commonsensical, advice (get enough sleep, be an active listener) interspersed with some Fletcherism (essential work broken down to three sessions of no more than 90 minutes, don't do more today than you can recover from today, clear physical clutter to clear mental clutter).

McKeown also claims to leverage cognitive research to validate his theories, and while there are passing references to things like perceptual load theory or the cognitive ease principle, this book is not about the research. It's a fast read and if nothing else is valuable for the idea of inverting hard problems to ask what they would look like if they were easy. That, and we should all be taking more _effortless_ naps.

### Start With Why
**Rating**: 3/10

Not much more to gain from this beyond the title. [Link](/books/start-with-why) to longer review.

### Turn the Ship Around
**Rating**: 6/10

A solid sea-faring jaunt. [Link](/books/turn-the-ship-around) to longer review.

### The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering
**Rating**: 8/10

This is one that straddles the line between business and tech, so in lieu of low value genre dissections, I've picked one. The book's reputation is merited, and [the Lindy effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) is in full display. [Link](/books/the-mythical-man-month) to longer review

### Designing Data-Intensive Applications
**Rating**: 10/10

Should be required reading for anyone working with data in a technical capacity. Takes you from files on a filesystem all the way to complex, distributed systems. I've read it a few times now and will probably make a habit of re-reading every once in a while to refresh.

### Fundamentals of Software Architecture
**Rating**: 7/10

Provides a decent overview of architectural concerns. As far as a handbook on architecture goes, you could do worse. Each topic is handled somewhat superficially, but this book shouldn't be treated as a deep dive into architecture topics but rather a foundation to build a mental model with. Architecture encountered in the wild will be messier than this still life, but this book is a good practicum. Also, I wish more books did this, but there are questions at the end of every chapter and there are architecture katas provided to practice.

### Data Mesh
**Rating**: 6.5/10

Rating this book feels inextricably linked to rating Data Mesh as a framework, which seeks to be the fourth wave of the data revolution, supplanting mutli-modal cloud architectures. While the idea is nice (who wouldn't want to work in a company where you could implement this?), it feels far too idealistic; this would be impossible to implement at the places I've been. There are some interesting ideas, and particularly the idea of a data product, and the book has a wonderful bibliography. Data Mesh is coming out of ThoughtWorks, so it'll have that cache and is worth knowing about even if you never have the good fortune to see even part of a data mesh come to fruition.
