### Xenoblade Chronicles 3

**Rating**: 7/10

I think I've finally got my fill of Xenoblade games. Played the first two and really enjoyed them, but even the best combat and world-building can't overcome sappy writing (the power of friendship is sharper than any sword!) and endlessly repeated catchphrases (hear that Noah, Lanz wants something a bit meatier!). The class system had potential, but by the end I wasn't even changing classes after hitting level caps because it didn't seem to matter. And speaking of not mattering, money and equipment in this game is useless. I didn't buy anything, and breezed through the game (except for the final boss, which takes over an hour to beat and for some inexplicable reason contains unskippable cutscenes so if you are misfortunate enough to wipe you need to start all over, denuding the ending of any dramatic tension or pace).

### Death's Door

**Rating**: 9/10

The isometric action-adventure game with unlockable traversal tools is a full genre, going back all the way to **at least** _A Link to The Past_ (which, depending on the day of the week, is my favorite SNES game). Death's Door is another entry in the field, and it's distinguished by a crystal-clear and compelling aesthetic. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but you don't have to with this genre. This game doesn't try and do too much -- there aren't a billion collectibles or a sprawling world map. It is uniquely itself, tight in its execution, and the ride lasts a perfect 12 or so hours.
