2022 was the year of good but not great books. Going through my goodreads profile, I only gave three books a five star rating (all appear on this list), but twnty-five got a four star rating. I doubt these metrics are statistically relevant.

## Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software

I read the first edition of this book a few years ago, and although it was stellar then, it was originally printed in 2000 and was certainly showing age. So I was positively giddy at the idea Petzold was updating it. Couple this book with something like the nand-2-tetris course (which is also stellar), and you have an excellent 1-2 punch for a deep practical understanding of how computers actually function. Absolutely a must read for anyone interested in computer internals.

## The Name of The Rose

I'll admit, I started this earlier in the year, and actually fell off. I thought the book was boring as a timeshare meeting, the multilingual jumps pretentious, the intellectual scaffolding overly didactic. I thought the whole thing a chore. But I'm glad I gave it another go. Once I got through the first hundred or so pages and realized what Eco was actually doing, how cleverly he was dismantling the detective thriller tropes and how adeptly he was playing with language (even in translation), I was hooked. It was a literal page-turner.

## The Anthropocene Reviewed

No reading list I put together would be complete without a science fiction novel.
