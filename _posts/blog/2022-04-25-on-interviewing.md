Outside of product delivery, hiring might be the most important thing a company does. Getting the right people is both exceptionally hard and exceptionally time-consuming, but it's something worth getting right. But there's the rub, because getting it right is also so darn hard -- there is sometimes years of delay in feedback upon hiring and success, and in the intervening time so many things might happen that affect the success of a candidate it's difficult to be sure we have any predictive judgement of whether our hiring criteria has any correlative effect.

Like most things, I try and create a cycle of 1) research 2) experiment 3) reflect 4) adapt. In this post, I'll detail some of my current approach to ensuring that the decisions I make to choose the right people are probablistically the most likely to lead to success in the role.

## A disclaimer
At the time of writing, I am currently a system architect. I don't have any direct reports, and the ultimate decision to hire or not isn't in my control -- I only make recommendations. An architect's role is one mostly of indirect influence, of persuasion, but if I were to be the ultimate decider, I'd use the same criteria below but would need to factor in multiple other opinions, some of which would be less structured or behaviorally-driven. As a manager, I'd give guidance to those interviewing to steer their interviews towards more of a structured behavioral style.

## Interview Approaches - The Research
Most research divides interviews into three broad-ish categories using the degree of structure and the nature of the questions asked:

1) _Conventional Unstructured Interview_ - "which is the most used personnel interview, refers to an informal conversation between the candidate and the interviewr, who formulates the questions according to the course of the conversation and without following any previous script"

2) _Structured Conventional Interview_, "in which the interveiwer works from a script or a series of guidelines about the information that must be obtained from each interviewee and it typically includes questions about credentials, technical skills, experience, and self-evaluations.

3) _Structured Behavioral Interview_ - "which is based on past behaviors"

In increasing the structure of the interview corresponds to increasing reliability in determinations of success. The research is pretty clear that a Structured Behavioral Interview is the most reliable indicator of a candidate's fit for purpose success potential of a role.
