Outside of delivering products, hiring is the most important thing your company does. On more charitable days, I might argue it's the most important. Getting the right and wrong people is the difference between success and failure. And we aren't just talking about hiring the best "talent", as if Silicon Valley's full-scale symbiosis with Hollywood wasn't complete. Often it's the right people in the right situations: you might not need a 10x developer, but someone who really rocks documentation, or someone who brings a fundamental DevOps perspective to the way they develop code.

And yet, at least in my experience, more time is spent in planning meetings for any given week than in planning for, interviewing, and assessing people. Most folks have a running list of questions they've asked over the years, and interviews are just skipping through those questions then rendering some sort of decision like a small claims court judge with an overbooked docket.

But why is interviewing so damn hard? Maybe we should phrase that differently: why is assessing

## Bundles of Noise and Bias

## A disclaimer
At the time of writing, I am currently a system architect. I don't have any direct reports, and the ultimate decision to hire or not isn't in my control -- I only make recommendations. An architect's role is one mostly of indirect influence, of persuasion, but if I were to be the ultimate decider, I'd use the same criteria below but would need to factor in multiple other opinions, some of which would be less structured or behaviorally-driven. As a manager, I'd give guidance to those interviewing to steer their interviews towards more of a structured behavioral style.

## Interview Approaches - The Research
Most research divides interviews into three broad-ish categories using the degree of structure and the nature of the questions asked:

1) _Conventional Unstructured Interview_ - "which is the most used personnel interview, refers to an informal conversation between the candidate and the interviewr, who formulates the questions according to the course of the conversation and without following any previous script"

2) _Structured Conventional Interview_, "in which the interveiwer works from a script or a series of guidelines about the information that must be obtained from each interviewee and it typically includes questions about credentials, technical skills, experience, and self-evaluations.

3) _Structured Behavioral Interview_ - "which is based on past behaviors"

In increasing the structure of the interview corresponds to increasing reliability in determinations of success. The research is pretty clear that a Structured Behavioral Interview is the most reliable indicator of a candidate's fit for purpose success potential of a role.
